Analysing the Covid dataset and Represent it. 

## Objective

To Create a Dashboard of analysed Covid dataset.

## Installation

There are 4 sql queries to generate the excel files by which we have created the Dashboard. "sql_code_to_create_xl_files", is to create the excel files,each queries had been executed and exported to csv files and the csv files were converted to excel worksheet for further usage as the Tableau public application does not sustain the csv files.
